## Computer Science

#### 1\. Process and thread

<br><br>
## Algorithm

#### 1\. Hashing table and hashing function
Hashing table is a mapping between keys and values.

<br><br>
## Math

### 1\. Derivative

### 2\. Integral

### 3\. Convex function

<br><br>
## Linear Algebra

#### 1. Rank

#### 2. Linear independent

<br><br>
## Deep Learning

#### 1. Deconvolution (Fractionally strided convolution, Transposed convolution)
In short, deconvolution is just to pad each pixel first and then do convolution. [This Github repo](https://github.com/vdumoulin/conv_arithmetic) has visualization for all kinds of convolutions. I highly recommend reads to check it out.

## Healthcare

#### 1\. Administrative data
Administrative data is the data from government or issurance company for administrative purpose, for example evaluating the quality of health care. Compared to EHR data from hospitals, administrative data has patient demongraphic information as well as dignosis information, but may not have detailed treatment or lab result information.
